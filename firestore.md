# Firestore Notes

Firestore is the free tier database.  You have 1 GB of storage and 50K queries per day.


Two Modes

* native
    * api firestore
    * real-time
    * has mobile/web client libraries
    * web console page in two locations
        * firestore page in GCP console
        * Firebase console
* datastore 
    * api datastore
    * Web console page in one location - GCP console


It looks like Firestore - native mode is the correct choice for our purposes.
